                Hey there, I'm Corey! I'm a web developer, but I also have worked in live video production for a good
                bit of time as well.
                I have worked exclusively in front end development with a focus on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. In
                this course, I'm hoping to reinforce my front-end knowledge and round out the gaps of my web development
                experience.
                In my time working in video, I worked as a producer, technical director, camera man, and more to create
                live video productions for collegiate and professional athletics.

                <br>
                <br>

                Outside of work, I'm either spending time with my wife and family, playing games, or watching esports.
                I'm also very interested in tattoo art and music. My favorite tattoo styles are traditional japanese,
                geometric, and black and grey realism. Some of my favorite musicians include Bring Me The Horizon,
                Linkin Park, and Post Malone. My favorite esports to watch are Call of Duty, Super Smash Bros., and
                League of Legends.
